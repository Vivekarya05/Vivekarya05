Conducting case studies on Demand–Supply fundamentals in the Australian NEM

Developing an Energy X AI portfolio with supervised/unsupervised ML models

Publishing dashboards and insights in Power BI & Qlik Sense

Enhancing my skills in Big Data (MapReduce, R-tree, Skyline queries)

Applying data storytelling to turn models into business insights
